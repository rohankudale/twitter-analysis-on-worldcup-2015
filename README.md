# twitter-analysis-on-worldcup-2015
The project is based on Big Data Analytics.
Here the tweets are fetched from twitter by creating application to get keys and the python code is written with tweepy library to authenticate the data request.
The fetched tweet is split and only name and Hashtag is used.
The data is map-reduced using Cloudera and fed to R for analysis.
R and R studio are used to get results in form of maps. Then the result is displayed on website.
